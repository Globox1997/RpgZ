# RpgZ
RpgZ changes the looting way of Minecraft. Instead of dropping items after getting killed, loot the corps.

### Installation
RpgZ is a mod built for the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/). It requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and [Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) to be installed separately; all other dependencies are installed with the mod.
